<h2 id="sec-2">Reaching IIIT-H </h2>






<h3 id="sec-2_1">From Airport </h3>



<p>
Directions from Hyderabad Airport(Cost around -600 by taxi)
Shamshabad (Airport) -&gt; Airport Rd-&gt; Kishanguda -&gt; Himayat Saagar
Jn -&gt; AP Police academy -&gt; Narsing Jn -&gt; Gachibowli -&gt; IIIT-H. It
is highly advisable to take a government approved pre-paid or
metered radio cab from Shamshabad Airport to IIIT-H Hyderabad.
</p>





<h3 id="sec-2_2">From Secuderabad Railway Station </h3>



<p>
If one is coming from Secuderabad railway station which is around
23km from IIIT-H, the auto fare would be roughly around Rs.250. One
can take an APSRTC bus to Mehdipatnam (No’s: 5 &amp; 49M), and another
bus from Mehdipatnam to IIIT-H (No’s: 216, 217).
</p>
<p>
Some trains, especially those coming from Bombay, stop at Begumpet
Railway Station which is about 16km from IIIT-H. If you plan to
come by bus, take bus No.49M from there to reach Mehdipatnam and
then another bus (Nos: 216 &amp; 217) to reach IIIT-H. An auto rickshaw
from Begumpet railway Station to IIIT-H direct might cost your
around Rs.150/- (approx.)
</p>





<h3 id="sec-2_3">From Nampally Railway Station </h3>



<p>
Reaching Hyderabad by a train and getting down at the Hyderabad
(Nampally) station would be the easiest way to reach us. The
institute is 16km from Nampally railway station. From the railway
station one can take an auto rickshaw (three wheeler) or APSRTC bus
(No’s: 216 &amp; 217) to reach IIIT-H. The auto rickshaw would cost
around Rs.150/- and bus fare would be around Rs.12/- and metro A/C
buses would cost around Rs.20
</p>





<h3 id="sec-2_4">From Lingampally Railway Station </h3>



<p>
Some trains from Mumbai also stop at Lingampally, which is just 7
kms from IIIT-H. Auto rickshaws and shared mini-taxis (tempos) are
available.
</p>







<h3 id="sec-2_5">From Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station (MGBS) </h3>



<p>
If one is reaching Hyderabad by bus and getting down at MGBS, then one
can reach the IIIT campus by APSRTC bus numbered 216 or 217 which
would cost around Rs.15/-. (Note: Bus numbers 216K and 216L do not go
via the institute campus).
</p>
<p>
N.B. Sometimes autos at the Railway stations or bus station may
refuse to come to Gachibowli particularly, if you arrive late in
the evening. You can then take an auto till Mehdipatnam and then
take another auto to Gachibowli from Mehdipatnam.
