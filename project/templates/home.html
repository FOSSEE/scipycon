    <div class="entry">
			<p><strong>Scipy.in </strong>is a conference providing opportunities to spread the use of
the Python programming language in the Scientific Computing community in
India. It provides a unique opportunity to interact with the "Who's who"
of the Python for Scientific Computing fraternity and learn, understand,
participate and contribute what is happening in the realms of Scientific
Computing using Python. Attendees of the conference and participants of
the sprints planned will be able to access and review the tools
available, apart from learning domain-specific applications and how the
tools apply to a plethora of application problems.<br>

One of the goals of the conference is to combine education, engineering,
and science with computing through the medium of Python and thereby
extrapolate on how powerful Scientific Computing is in various fields
and among different communities.</p>
